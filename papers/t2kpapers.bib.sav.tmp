  abstract        = {Information extraction (IE) systems discover structured in- formation from natural language text, to enable much richer querying and data mining than possible directly over the unstructured text. Unfortunately, IE is generally a com- putationally expensive process, and hence improving its ef- ficiency, so that it scales over large volumes of text, is of critical importance. State-of-the-art approaches for scaling the IE process focus on one text collection at a time. These approaches prioritize the extraction effort by learning key- word queries to identify the “useful” documents for the IE task at hand, namely, those that lead to the extraction of structured “tuples.” These approaches, however, do not at- tempt to predict which text collections are useful for the IE task—and hence merit further processing—and which ones will not contribute any useful output—and hence should be ignored altogether, for efficiency. In this paper, we focus on an especially valuable family of text sources, the so-called deep web collections, whose (remote) contents are only ac- cessible via querying. Specifically, we introduce and study techniques for ranking deep web collections for an IE task, to prioritize the extraction effort by focusing on collections with substantial numbers of useful documents for the task. We study both (adaptations of) state-of-the-art resource selec- tion strategies for distributed information retrieval, as well as IE-specific approaches. Our large-scale experimental eval- uation over realistic deep web collections, and for several different IE tasks, shows the merits and limitations of the alternative families of approaches, and provides a roadmap for addressing this critically important building block for efficient, scalable information extraction.},

It is a central problem in information extraction since it is critical for tasks such as knowledge base population and question answering. In this work, we focus on extending the training procedure of our newly proposed general purpose joint model [4] for entity recognition and relation extraction with adversarial training (AT) [2]. Our model performs the two tasks of entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in a number of different contexts (i.e., news, biomedical, real estate) and languages (i.e., English, Dutch) without relying on any manually engineered features nor additional NLP tools. In summary, our proposed model: (i) does not rely on external NLP tools nor hand-crafted features, (ii) entities and relations within the same text fragment (typically a sentence) are extracted simultaneously, where (iii) an entity can be involved in multiple relations at once. To evaluate the proposed AT method, we perform the same set of experiments while we apply AT on top of our joint model. Compared to the baseline model, applying AT during training leads to a consistent additional increase in joint extraction effectiveness.},

Current approaches to identify sub-events within a given event (e.g., a goal during a soccer match), essentially do not exploit the sequential nature of social media streams. We address this shortcoming by framing the sub-event detection problem in social media streams as a sequence labeling task and adopt a neural sequence architecture that explicitly accounts for the chronological order of posts. Specifically, we (i) establish aneural baseline that outperforms a graph-based state-of-the-art method for binary sub-event detection (2.7% F1 improvement), as well as (ii) demonstrate superiority of a recurrent neural network model on the posts sequence level for labeled sub-events (2.4% F1 improvement over non-sequential models).},

Thus, the performance of such joint models depends on the quality of the features obtained from these NLP tools. However, these features are not always accurate for various languages and contexts. In this paper, we propose a joint neural model which performs entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously, without the need of any manually extracted features or the use of any external tool. Specifically, we model the entity recognition task using a CRF (Conditional Random Fields) layer and the relation extraction task as a multi-head selection problem (i.e., potentially identify multiple relations for each entity). We present an extensive experimental setup, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using datasets from various contexts (i.e., news, biomedical, real estate) and languages (i.e., English, Dutch). Our model outperforms the previous neural models that use automatically extracted features, while it performs within a reasonable margin of feature-based neural models, or even beats them.},

  abstract        = {In processing human produced text using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, two fundamental subtasks that arise are (i) segmentation of the plain text into meaningful subunits (e.g., entities), and (ii) dependency parsing, to establish relations between subunits. Such structural interpretation of text provides essential building blocks for upstream expert system tasks: e.g., from interpreting textual real estate ads, one may want to provide an accurate price estimate and/or provide selection filters for end users looking for a particular property -- which all could rely on knowing the types and number of rooms, etc. In this paper we develop a relatively simple and effective neural joint model that performs both segmentation and dependency parsing together, instead of one after the other as in most state-of-the-art works. We will focus in particular on the real estate ad setting, aiming to convert an ad to a structured description, which we name property tree, comprising the tasks of (1) identifying important entities of a property (e.g., rooms) from classifieds and (2) structuring them into a tree format. In this work, we propose a new joint model that is able to tackle the two tasks simultaneously and construct the property tree by (i) avoiding the error propagation that would arise from the subtasks one after the other in a pipelined fashion, and (ii) exploiting the interactions between the subtasks. For this purpose, we perform an extensive comparative study of the pipeline methods and the new proposed joint model, reporting an improvement of over three percentage points in the overall edge F1 score of the property tree. Also, we propose attention methods, to encourage our model to focus on salient tokens during the construction of the property tree. Thus we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of attentive neural architectures for the proposed joint model, showcasing a further improvement of two percentage points in edge F1 score for our application. While the results demonstrated are for the particular real estate setting, the model is generic in nature, and thus could be equally applied to other expert system scenarios requiring the general tasks of both (i) detecting entities (segmentation) and (ii) establishing relations among them (dependency parsing).},

First, in language modeling, we show how to increase hidden state sizes in recurrent layers without increasing the number of parameters, leading to more expressive models. Second, for sequence labeling, we show that word embeddings with predefined sparseness lead to similar performance as dense embeddings, at a fraction of the number of trainable parameters.},

In practice however, most evaluation scenarios only allow us to conclusively determine the relevance towards the particular assessor that provided the judgments. A factor that cannot be ignored when extending conclusions made from assessors towards users, is the possible disagreement on relevance, assuming that a single gold truth label does not exist. This paper presents and analyzes the predicted relevance model (PRM), which allows predicting a particular result’s relevance for a random user, based on an observed assessment and knowledge on the average disagreement between assessors. With the PRM, existing evaluation metrics designed to measure binary assessor relevance, can be transformed into more robust and effectively graded measures that evaluate relevance towards a random user. It also leads to a principled way of quantifying multiple graded or categorical relevance levels for use as gains in established graded relevance measures, such as normalized discounted cumulative gain, which nowadays often use heuristic and data-independent gain values. Given a set of test topics with graded relevance judgments, the PRM allows evaluating systems on different scenarios, such as their capability of retrieving top results, or how well they are able to filter out non-relevant ones. Its use in actual evaluation scenarios is illustrated on several information retrieval test collections.},

This paper proposes a method to capture this user disagreement and integrate it into the evaluation procedure.
First, we present experiments that investigate the user disagreement. After that, a probabilistic model is proposed that results in a weighting of the relevance levels with a probabilistic interpretation. This is followed by a validity analysis, and an explanation of how to integrate the model with well-established evaluation metrics.

  Abstract                 = {Research on evaluation of IR systems has led to the insight that a robust evaluation strategy requires tests on a large number of events/queries. However, especially for event detection, the number of manually labeled events may be limited. In this paper we investigate how to optimize the evaluation strategy in those cases to maximize robustness. We also introduce two new vector space models for event detection that aim to incorporate bursty information of terms and compare these with existing models. Our experiments show that by using graded relevance levels we can reduce the impact of subjectivity and ambiguity of event detection evaluation. We also show that although user disagreement is significant, it has no real impact on the ranking of the results.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding and reasoning about textual data is one of the important topics in artificial intelligence and is being addressed by various research communities, ranging from knowledge representation, over natural language processing to text mining. Each community provides a different set of often overlapping intuitions, tools and methodologies for working with text.
Event processing from news and social media can be seen as a subtopic of text understanding [1, 2, 3, 4]. It comprises different tasks, including New and Retrospective Event Discovery, Event Type Classification and Event Template Extraction.
Research on event processing requires access to annotated data covering different tasks in the event processing pipeline. Over the last decades, several datasets have been created covering event discovery and event extraction, e.g., [5, 6, 7]. These datasets are rather limited in scope. For example, they contain articles from only few selected sources, or they contain a limited number of annotated events with a high selection bias (e.g., towards larger or well defined events like natural disasters or terrorism). Using such limited datasets to evaluate solutions for the event processing tasks may lead to favoring approaches that do not work well on real-world datasets. The main reasons for these limitations are (1) limited access to data resources and (2) the required and expensive manual annotations.
The main contributions we are working towards are (1) a systematic methodology for efficiently creating a large golden standard of manually annotated events over a large corpus of news articles with a realistic distribution over the covered topics and events, and (2) a resulting annotated corpus a resulting annotated corpus of 10,000 English general news articles embedded in 31 million news articles.},

Low-dimensional continuous representations or embeddings can counter that sparseness problem: their high representational power is exploited in deep clustering algorithms. While deep clustering has been studied extensively in computer vision, relatively little work has focused on NLP. The method we propose, learns discriminative features from both an autoencoder and a sentence embedding, then uses assignments from a clustering algorithm as supervision to update weights of the encoder network. Experiments on three short text datasets empirically validate the effectiveness of our method.},

Proper evaluation of keyphrase extraction requires large test collections with multiple opinions, currently not available for research. In this paper, we (i) present a set of test collections derived from various sources with multiple annotations (which we also refer to as opinions in the remained of the paper) for each document, (ii) systematically evaluate keyphrase extraction using several supervised and unsupervised AKE techniques, (iii) and experimentally analyze the effects of disagreement on AKE evaluation. Our newly created set of test collections spans different types of topical content from general news and magazines, and is annotated with multiple annotations per article by a large user panel. Our user study shows that for a given document there seems to be a large disagreement on the preferred keyphrases, suggesting the need for multiple opinions per document. A first systematic evaluation of ranking and classification of keyphrases using both unsupervised and supervised AKE techniques on the test collections shows a superior effectiveness of supervised models, even for a low annotation effort and with basic positional and frequency features, and highlights the importance of a suitable keyphrase candidate generation approach. We also study the influence of multiple opinions, training data and document length on evaluation of keyphrase extraction. Our new test collection for keyphrase extraction is one of the largest of its kind and will be made available to stimulate future work to improve reliable evaluation of new keyphrase extractors.},

Thus, annotations from single authors or readers lead to noisy training data and poor extraction performance of the resulting supervised extractor. We provide a simple but effective solution to still work with such data by reweighting the importance of unlabeled candidate phrases in a two stage Positive Unlabeled Learning setting. We show that performance of trained keyphrase extractors approximates a classifier trained on articles labeled by multiple annotators, leading to higher average F1scores and better rankings of keyphrases.

The amount of manual labeling can be significantly reduced by applying distant supervision, which generates training data by aligning large text corpora with existing knowledge bases. This typically results in a highly noisy training set, where many training sentences do not express the intended relation. In this paper, we propose to combine distant supervision with minimal human supervi- sion by annotating features (in particular shortest dependency paths) rather than complete relation instances. Such feature labeling eliminates noise from the initial training set, resulting in a significant increase of pre- cision at the expense of recall. We further improve on this approach by introducing the Semantic Label Propagation (SLP) method, which uses the similarity between low-dimensional representations of candidate training instances to again extend the (filtered) training set in order to increase recall while maintaining high precision. Our strategy is evaluated on an established test collection designed for knowledge base popula- tion (KBP) from the TAC KBP English slot filling task. The experimental results show that SLP leads to substantial performance gains when compared to existing approaches while requiring an almost negligible human annotation effort.},

We propose a 4-step approach to solve this. First, a classifier is trained to determine whether a Twitter user is likely to post tweets about newsworthy stories. Second, tweets posted by these users during the time interval of interest are clustered into topics. For this clustering, the cosine similarity between a boosted tf-idf representation of the tweets is used. Third, we use a classifier to estimate the confidence that the obtained topics are newsworthy. Finally, for each obtained newswor- thy topic, a descriptive headline is generated together with relevant keywords, tweets and pictures. Experimental re- sults show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper focuses on an automatic and accurate approach for finding similar users in social networks. Many types of social networks could benefit from such techniques, but the focus in this paper is on online photo services. The similarity between users needs to be considered on two different levels, i.e., the semantic similarity (or correspondence in tagging behavior), and the similarity in terms of social relations. In recent work, heuristic formulas were introduced for the tag commonness (TC) and the link strength (LS), with an adaptive combination scheme to describe how relevant each of these similarity aspects are for particular users, in order to define the user similarity. This paper presents an experiment, where a Learning-to-Rank approach is used to find suitable combinations of TC and LS related parameter values, hence taking into account the proficiency of users to tag their photos, and their noticeability in the online community, in order to obtain an overall user similarity. The user experiments show that the results with this learning-to-rank approach are significantly better than with a former, heuristic, approach.},

Therefore an intelligent online publishing strategy is of the highest importance to publishers. A prerequisite for being able to optimize any online strategy, is to have trustworthy predictions of how popular new online content may become. This paper presents a novel methodology to model and predict the popularity of online news. We first introduce a new strategy and mathematical model to capture view patterns of online news. After a thorough analysis of such view patterns, we show that well-chosen base functions lead to suitable models, and show how the influence of day versus night on the total view patterns can be taken into account to further increase the accuracy, without leading to more complex models. Second, we turn to the prediction of future popularity, given recently published content. By means of a new real-world dataset, we show that the combination of features related to content, meta-data, and the temporal behavior leads to significantly improved predictions, compared to existing approaches which only consider features based on the historical popularity of the considered articles. Whereas traditionally linear regression is used for the application under study, we show that the more expressive gradient tree boosting method proves beneficial for predicting news popularity.},

The data used are the ratings of the oral performances of the same 82 candidates on both oral test components, which were administered within the same week. The correlation on the overall scores is high, but lower on the oral test component. Further analyses, including linear regression and multifaceted Rasch analysis, indicate that the B2 level was interpreted differently in the two tests. The results show that using the same language proficiency scales as the basis for rating scale criteria may lead to superficial correspondences or a perceived equivalence but does not necessarily lead to greater comparability of shared criteria. The findings of this study are especially useful for contexts in which different tests use similar criteria that are based on the same descriptors, and comparability is only assumed.},

By sampling the code vector from specific regions of this latent space during decoding and imposing prior attention generated from it in the seq2seq model, output can be steered towards having certain attributes. This is demonstrated for the task of sentence simplification, where the latent code vector allows control over output length and lexical simplification, and enables fine-tuning to optimize for different evaluation metrics.},

Backpropagation through time is the algorithm that is commonly used to train these networks on specific tasks. Many deep learning frameworks have their own implementation of training and sampling procedures for recurrent neural networks, while there are in fact multiple other possibilities to choose from and other parameters to tune. In the existing literature, this is very often overlooked or ignored. In this paper, we therefore give an overview of possible training and sampling schemes for character-level recurrent neural networks to solve the task of predicting the next token in a given sequence. We test these different schemes on a variety of datasets, neural network architectures and parameter settings, and formulate a number of take-home recommendations. The choice of training and sampling scheme turns out to be subject to a number of trade-offs, such as training stability, sampling time, model performance and implementation effort, but is largely independent of the data. Perhaps the most surprising result is that transferring hidden states for correctly initializing the model on subsequences often leads to unstable training behavior depending on the dataset.},

  abstract        = {In adversarial training, a set of models learn together by pursuing competing goals, usually defined on single data instances. However, in relational learning and other non-i.i.d domains, goals can also be defined over sets of instances. For example, a link predictor for the is-a relation needs to be consistent with the transitivity property: if is-a(x_1, x_2) and is-a(x_2, x_3) hold, is-a(x_1, x_3) needs to hold as well. Here we use such assumptions for deriving an inconsistency loss, measuring the degree to which the model violates the assumptions on an adversarially-generated set of examples. The training objective is defined as a minimax problem, where an adversary finds the most offending adversarial examples by maximising the inconsistency loss, and the model is trained by jointly minimising a supervised loss and the inconsistency loss on the adversarial examples. This yields the first method that can use function-free Horn clauses (as in Datalog) to regularise any neural link predictor, with complexity independent of the domain size. We show that for several link prediction models, the optimisation problem faced by the adversary has efficient closed-form solutions. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks indicate that given suitable prior knowledge, our method can significantly improve neural link predictors on all relevant metrics.},

Collaborative filtering has the disadvantage that it relies on explicit ratings, which are often unavailable, and generally disregards the temporal nature of music consumption. On the other hand, item co-occurrence algorithms, such as the recently introduced word2vec-based recommenders, are typically left without an effective user representation. In this paper, we present a new approach to model users through recurrent neural networks by sequentially processing consumed items, represented by any type of embeddings and other context features. This way we obtain semantically rich user representations, which capture a user’s musical taste over time. Our experimental analysis on large-scale user data shows that our model can be used to predict future songs a user will likely listen to, both in the short and long term.},

Yet, a major challenge is how to efficiently incorporate commonsense knowledge into such models. A recent approach regularizes relation and entity representations by propositionalization of first-order logic rules. However, propositionalization does not scale beyond domains with only few entities and rules. In this paper we present a highly efficient method for incorporating implication rules into distributed representations for automated knowledge base construction. We map entity-tuple embeddings into an approximately Boolean space and encourage a partial ordering over relation embeddings based on implication rules mined from WordNet. Surprisingly, we find that the strong restriction of the entity-tuple embedding space does not hurt the expressiveness of the model and even acts as a regularizer that improves generalization. By incorporating few commonsense rules, we achieve an increase of 2 percentage points mean average precision over a matrix factorization baseline, while observing a negligible increase in runtime.},

  abstract       = {We create text representations by weighing word embeddings using idf information.A novel median-based loss is designed to mitigate the negative effect of outliers.A dataset of semantically related textual pairs from Wikipedia and Twitter is made.Our method outperforms all word embedding baselines in a semantic similarity task.Our method is out-of-the-box and thus requires no retraining in different contexts. Short text messages such as tweets are very noisy and sparse in their use of vocabulary. Traditional textual representations, such as tf-idf, have difficulty grasping the semantic meaning of such texts, which is important in applications such as event detection, opinion mining, news recommendation, etc. We constructed a method based on semantic word embeddings and frequency information to arrive at low-dimensional representations for short texts designed to capture semantic similarity. For this purpose we designed a weight-based model and a learning procedure based on a novel median-based loss function. This paper discusses the details of our model and the optimization methods, together with the experimental results on both Wikipedia and Twitter data. We find that our method outperforms the baseline approaches in the experiments, and that it generalizes well on different word embeddings without retraining. Our method is therefore capable of retaining most of the semantic information in the text, and is applicable out-of-the-box.},

The level of description can range from absolutely nothing to fine-grained annotations at the level of frames. Based on these annotations, certain parts of the video content are more searchable than others.
Within the context of the STEAMER project, we developed an innovative end-to-end system that attempts to tackle the problem of unsupervised retrieval of news video content, leveraging multiple information streams and deep neural networks. In particular, we extracted keyphrases and named entities from transcripts, subsequently refining these keyphrases and named entities based on their visual appearance in the news video content. Moreover, to allow for fine-grained frame-level annotations, we temporally located high-confidence keyphrases in the news video content. To that end, we had to tackle challenges such as the automatic construction of training sets and the automatic assessment of keyphrase imageability.
In this paper, we discuss the main components of our end-to-end system, capable of transforming textual and visual information into fine-grained video annotations.},

  abstract        = {Levering data on social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, requires information retrieval algorithms to become able to relate very short text fragments to each other. Traditional text similarity methods such as tf-idf cosine-similarity, based on word overlap, mostly fail to produce good results in this case, since word overlap is little or non-existent. Recently, distributed word representations, or word embeddings, have been shown to successfully allow words to match on the semantic level. In order to pair short text fragments -- as a concatenation of separate words - an adequate distributed sentence representation is needed, in existing literature often obtained by naively combining the individual word representations. We therefore investigated several text representations as a combination of word embeddings in the context of semantic pair matching. This paper investigates the effectiveness of several such naive techniques, as well as traditional tf-idf similarity, for fragments of different lengths. Our main contribution is a first step towards a hybrid method that combines the strength of dense distributed representations - as opposed to sparse term matching - with the strength of tf-idf based methods to automatically reduce the impact of less informative terms. Our new approach outperforms the existing techniques in a toy experimental set-up, leading to the conclusion that the combination of word embeddings and tf-idf information might lead to a better model for semantic content within very short text fragments.},

We correlate the collection-based relevant verticals obtained from these approaches to the real user vertical intent, and show that they can be aligned relatively well. The set of relevant verticals defined by those approaches could therefore serve as an approximate but reliable ground-truth for evaluating vertical selection, avoiding the need for collecting explicit user vertical intent, and vice versa.},

In this paper, we revisit probability ranking principle (PRP)-based models, probability of relevance (PR) models, and language models, finding conceptual differences in their definition and interrelationships. The probabilistic model of the PRP has not been explicitly defined previously, but doing so leads to the formulation of two actual principles with different objectives. First, the belief probability ranking principle (BPRP), which considers uncertain relevance between known documents and the current query, and second, the popularity probability ranking principle (PPRP), which considers the probability of relevance of documents among multiple queries with the same features. Our analysis shows how some of the discussed PR models implement the BPRP or the PPRP while others do not. However, for some models the parameter estimation is challenging. Finally, language models are often presented as related to PR models. However, we find that language models differ from PR models in every aspect of a probabilistic model and the effectiveness of language models cannot be explained by the PRP.},

However, the search in the central index also hurts efficiency. Additionally, we show that the effectiveness of these approaches varies substantially with the sampled documents. This paper proposes Taily, a novel shard selection algorithm that models a query's score distribution in each shard as a Gamma distribution and selects shards with highly scored documents in the tail of the distribution. Taily estimates the parameters of score distributions based on the mean and variance of the score function's features in the collections and shards. Because Taily operates on term statistics instead of document samples, it is efficient and has deterministic effectiveness. Experiments on large web collections (Gov2, CluewebA and CluewebB) show that Taily achieves similar effectiveness to sample-based approaches, and improves upon their efficiency by roughly 20% in terms of used resources and response time.},

  abstract        = {Solving arithmetic word problems is a cornerstone task in assessing language understanding and reasoning capabilities in NLP systems. Recent works use automatic extraction and ranking of candidate solution equations providing the answer to arithmetic word problems. In this work, we explore novel approaches to score such candidate solution equations using tree-structured recursive neural network (Tree-RNN) configurations. The advantage of this Tree-RNN approach over using more established sequential representations, is that it can naturally capture the structure of the equations. Our proposed method consists of transforming the mathematical expression of the equation into an expression tree. Further, we encode this tree into a Tree-RNN by using different Tree-LSTM architectures. Experimental results show that our proposed method (i) improves overall performance with more than 3% accuracy points compared to previous state-of-the-art, and with over 15% points on a subset of problems that require more complex reasoning, and (ii) outperforms sequential LSTMs by 4% accuracy points on such more complex problems.},

We thus frame the semantic comprehension of procedural text such as recipes, as fairly generic NLP subtasks, covering (i) entity recognition (ingredients, tools and actions), (ii) relation extraction (what ingredients and tools are involved in the actions), and (iii) zero anaphora resolution (link actions to implicit arguments, e.g., results from previous recipe steps). Further, our Recipe Instruction Semantic Corpus (RISeC) dataset includes textual descriptions for the zero anaphora, to facilitate language generation thereof. Besides the dataset itself, we contribute a pipeline neural architecture that addresses entity and relation extraction as well as identification of zero anaphora. These basic building blocks can facilitate more advanced downstream applications (e.g., question answering, conversational agents).},

Two scenarios are analyzed, in which a large coreference corpus in a high-resource language is used for coreference predictions in a smaller language, i.e., by machine translating either the training corpus, or the test data. In our empirical evaluation of coreference resolution using the two scenarios on several medium-resource languages, we find no improvement over monolingual baseline models. Our analysis of the various sources of error inherent to the studied scenarios, reveals that in fact the quality of contemporary machine translation tools is the main limiting factor.},

First, the PRP considers the relevance of particular documents, whereas PR models consider the relevance of any query-document pair. Second, unlike PR models, language models consider draws of terms and documents. We bridge the first gap by showing how the probability measure of PR models can be used to define the probabilistic model of the PRP. Furthermore, we argue that given the differences between PR models and language models, the second gap cannot be bridged at the probabilistic model level. We instead define a new PR model based on logistic regression, which has a similar score function to the one of the query likelihood model. The performance of both models is strongly correlated, hence providing a bridge for the second gap at the functional and ranking level. Understanding language models in relation with logistic regression models opens ample new research directions which we propose as future work.},

Yet, counterfactual data generation is costly since it relies on human annotation. Thus, we propose a novel solution that only requires annotation of a small fraction (e.g., 1%) of the original training data, and uses automatic generation of extra counterfactuals in an encoding vector space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in sentiment classification, using IMDb data for training and other sets for OOD tests (i.e., Amazon, SemEval and Yelp). We achieve noticeable accuracy improvements by adding only 1% manual counterfactuals: +3% compared to adding +100% in-distribution training samples, +1.3% compared to alternate counterfactual approaches.},

For that study, we introduce TempEL, an entity linking dataset that consists of time-stratified English Wikipedia snapshots from 2013 to 2022, from which we collect both anchor mentions of entities, and these target entities’ descriptions. By capturing such temporal aspects, our newly introduced TempEL resource contrasts with currently existing entity linking datasets, which are composed of fixed mentions linked to a single static version of a target Knowledge Base (e.g., Wikipedia 2010 for CoNLL-AIDA). Indeed, for each of our collected temporal snapshots, TempEL contains links to entities that are continual, i.e., occur in all of the years, as well as completely new entities that appear for the first time at some point. Thus, we enable to quantify the performance of current state-of-the-art EL models for: (i) entities that are subject to changes over time in their Knowledge Base descriptions as well as their mentions’ contexts, and (ii) newly created entities that were previously non-existing (e.g., at the time the EL model was trained). Our experimental results show that in terms of temporal performance degradation, (i) continual entities suffer a decrease of up to 3.1\% EL accuracy, while (ii) for new entities this accuracy drop is up to 17.9\%. This highlights the challenge of the introduced TempEL dataset and opens new research prospects in the area of time-evolving entity disambiguation.},

  abstract        = {Skills play a central role in the job market and many human resources (HR) processes. In the wake of other digital experiences, today's online job market has candidates expecting to see the right opportunities based on their skill set. Similarly, enterprises increasingly need to use data to guarantee that the skills within their workforce remain future-proof. However, structured information about skills is often missing, and processes building on self- or manager-assessment have shown to struggle with issues around adoption, completeness, and freshness of the resulting data. Extracting skills is a highly challenging task, given the many thousands of possible skill labels mentioned either explicitly or merely described implicitly and the lack of finely annotated training corpora. Previous work on skill extraction overly simplifies the task to an explicit entity detection task or builds on manually annotated training data that would be infeasible if applied to a complete vocabulary of skills. We propose an end-to-end system for skill extraction, based on distant supervision through literal matching. We propose and evaluate several negative sampling strategies, tuned on a small validation dataset, to improve the generalization of skill extraction towards implicitly mentioned skills, despite the lack of such implicit skills in the distantly supervised data. We observe that using the ESCO taxonomy to select negative examples from related skills yields the biggest improvements, and combining three different strategies in one model further increases the performance, up to 8 percentage points in RP@5. We introduce a manually annotated evaluation benchmark for skill extraction based on the ESCO taxonomy, on which we validate our models. We release the benchmark dataset for research purposes to stimulate further research on the task.},

  abstract        = {Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are widely used in digital learning systems, as they allow for automating the assessment process. However, due to the increased digital literacy of students and the advent of social media platforms, MCQ tests are widely shared online, and teachers are continuously challenged to create new questions, which is an expensive and time-consuming task. A particularly sensitive aspect of MCQ creation is to devise relevant distractors, i.e., wrong answers that are not easily identifiable as being wrong. This paper studies how a large existing set of manually created answers and distractors for questions over a variety of domains, subjects, and languages can be leveraged to help teachers in creating new MCQs, by the smart reuse of existing distractors. We built several data-driven models based on context-aware question and distractor representations, and compared them with static feature-based models. The proposed models are evaluated with automated metrics and in a realistic user test with teachers. Both automatic and human evaluations indicate that context-aware models consistently outperform a static feature-based approach. For our best-performing context-aware model, on average 3 distractors out of the 10 shown to teachers were rated as high-quality distractors. We create a performance benchmark, and make it public, to enable comparison between different approaches and to introduce a more standardized evaluation of the task. The benchmark contains a test of 298 educational questions covering multiple subjects & languages and a 77k multilingual pool of distractor vocabulary for future research.},

  abstract        = {Natural language processing technology has made significant progress in recent years, fuelled by increasingly powerful general language models. This has also inspired a sizeable body of work targeted specifically towards the educational domain, where the creation of questions (both for assessment and practice) is a laborious/expensive effort. Thus, automatic Question-Generation (QG) solutions have been proposed and studied. Yet, according to a recent survey of the educational QG community’s progress, a common baseline dataset unifying multiple domains and question forms (e.g., multiple choice vs. fill-the-gap), including readily available baseline models to compare against, is largely missing. This is the gap we aim to fill with this paper. In particular, we introduce a high-quality dataset in the educational domain, containing over 3,000 entries, comprising (i) multiple-choice questions, (ii) the corresponding answers (including distractors), and (iii) associated passages from the course material used as sources for the questions. Each question is phrased in two forms, normal and cloze (i.e., fill-the-gap), and correct answers are linked to source documents with sentence-level annotations. Thus, our versatile dataset can be used for both question and distractor generation, as well as to explore new challenges such as question format conversion. Furthermore, 903 questions are accompanied by their cognitive complexity level as per Bloom’s taxonomy. All questions have been generated by educational experts rather than crowd workers to ensure they are maintaining educational and learning standards. Our analysis and experiments suggest distinguishable differences between our dataset and commonly used ones for question generation for educational purposes. We believe this new dataset can serve as a valuable resource for research and evaluation in the educational domain. The dataset and baselines are made available to support further research in question generation for education ( https://github.com/hadifar/question-generation).},

The resulting dataset contains 192 conversations and is used to test three hypotheses related to the expression and annotation of emotions. First, we hypothesize that there is a discrepancy between the emotion annotations of the participant (the experiencer) and the annotations of our external annotator (the observer). Furthermore, we hypothesize that the personality of the participants has an influence on the emotions they expressed, and on the way they evaluated (annotated) these emotions. We found that for an external, trained annotator, not all emotion labels were equally easy to work with. We also noticed that the trained annotator had a tendency to opt for emotion labels that were more centered in the valence-arousal space, while participants made more `extreme' annotations. For the second hypothesis, we discovered a positive correlation between the personality trait extraversion and the emotion dimensions valence and dominance in our sample. Finally, for the third premise, we observed a positive correlation between the internal-external agreement on emotion labels and the personality traits conscientiousness and extraversion. Our insights and findings will be used in future research to conduct a larger Wizard of Oz experiment.},

inclusion of causal knowledge, but their practical adoption remains limited as a
result of their inability to deal with unstructured data. While neural networks do
not have this limitation, they are not interpretable and are inherently unable to deal
with causal structure in the input space. Our goal is to build neural networks that
combine the advantages of both approaches. Motivated by the perspective to inject
causal knowledge while training such neural networks, this work presents initial
steps in that direction. We demonstrate how a neural network can be trained to
output conditional probabilities, providing approximately the same functionality
as a Bayesian Network. Additionally, we propose two training strategies that allow
encoding the independence relations inferred from a given causal structure into the
neural network. We present initial results in a proof-of-concept setting, showing
that the neural model acts as an understudy to its Bayesian Network counterpart,
approximating its probabilistic and causal properties.},

In this paper, we cast model explanation as the causal inference problem of estimating causal effects of real-world concepts on the output behavior of ML models given actual input data. We introduce CEBaB, a new benchmark dataset for assessing concept-based explanation methods in Natural Language Processing (NLP). CEBaB consists of short restaurant reviews with human-generated counterfactual reviews in which an aspect (food, noise, ambiance, service) of the dining experience was modified. Original and counterfactual reviews are annotated with multiply-validated sentiment ratings at the aspect-level and review-level. The rich structure of CEBaB allows us to go beyond input features to study the effects of abstract, real-world concepts on model behavior. We use CEBaB to compare the quality of a range of concept-based explanation methods covering different assumptions and conceptions of the problem, and we seek to establish natural metrics for comparative assessments of these methods.},

In response, many explainability methods make no use of counterfactual texts, assuming they will be unavailable. In this paper, we show that robust causal explainability methods can be created using approximate counterfactuals, which can be written by humans to approximate a specific counterfactual or simply sampled using metadata-guided heuristics. The core of our proposal is the Causal Proxy Model (CPM). A CPM explains a black-box model N because it is trained to have the same actual input/output behavior as N while creating neural representations that can be intervened upon to simulate the counterfactual input/output behavior of N. Furthermore, we show that the best CPM for N performs comparably to N in making factual predictions, which means that the CPM can simply replace N, leading to more explainable deployed models.},

In this study, we propose a strategy for guiding LLMs such as ChatGPT, in generating relevant distractors by prompting them with question items automatically retrieved from a question bank as well-chosen in-context examples. We evaluate our LLM-based solutions using a quantitative assessment on an existing test set, as well as through quality annotations by human experts, i.e., teachers. We found that on average 53% of the generated distractors presented to the teachers were rated as high-quality, i.e., suitable for immediate use as is, outperforming the state-of-the-art model. We also show the gains of our approach 1 in generating high-quality distractors by comparing it with a zero-shot ChatGPT and a few-shot ChatGPT prompted with static examples.},

Since providing any annotation in this domain requires human expert effort, we aim to avoid it entirely and explore the task of converting existing texts into new gap-filling exercises, purely based on an example exercise, without explicit instruction or detailed annotation of the intended grammar topics. We contribute (i) a novel neural network architecture specifically designed for the aforementioned gap-filling exercise generation task, and (ii) a real-world benchmark dataset for French grammar. We show that our model for this French grammar gap-filling exercise generation outperforms a competitive baseline classifier by 8% in F1 percentage points, achieving an average F1 score of 82%. Our model implementation and the dataset are made publicly available to foster future research, thus offering a standardized evaluation and baseline solution of the proposed partially annotated data prediction task in grammar exercise creation.},

We contribute the IDAS approach, which collects a set of descriptive utterance labels by prompting a Large Language Model, starting from a well-chosen seed set of prototypical utterances, to bootstrap an In-Context Learning procedure to generate labels for non-prototypical utterances. The utterances and their resulting noisy labels are then encoded by a frozen pre-trained encoder, and subsequently clustered to recover the latent intents. For the unsupervised task (without any intent labels) IDAS outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to +7.42% in standard cluster metrics for the Banking, StackOverflow, and Transport datasets. For the semi-supervised task (with labels for a subset of intents) IDAS surpasses 2 recent methods on the CLINC benchmark without even using labeled data.},

Existing methods to career path prediction rely on large amounts of private career history data to model the interactions between job titles and companies.

We introduce a structured dataset of 2,164 anonymized career histories, annotated with ESCO occupation labels.

We develop a skill-based model and a text-based model for career path prediction, which achieve 35.24% and 39.61% recall@10 respectively on our dataset. Finally, we show that both approaches are complementary as a hybrid approach achieves the strongest result with 43.01% recall@10.},

Yet, current QG systems either consider just a single sentence or paragraph (thus do not include a selection step), or do not consider this educational viewpoint of content selection. Aiming to fill this research gap with a solution for educational document level QG, we thus propose to select contents for QG based on relevance and topic diversity.

  abstract        = {The brittleness of finetuned language model performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples in unseen domains has been well-studied for English, yet is unexplored for multi-lingual models. Therefore, we study generalization to OOD test data specifically in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer settings, analyzing performance impacts of both language and domain shifts between train and test data. We further assess the effectiveness of counterfactually augmented data (CAD) in improving OOD generalization for the cross-lingual setting, since CAD has been shown to benefit in a monolingual English setting. Finally, we propose two new approaches for OOD generalization that avoid the costly annotation process associated with CAD, by exploiting the power of recent large language models (LLMs). We experiment with 3 multilingual models, LaBSE, mBERT, and XLM-R trained on English IMDb movie reviews, and evaluate on OOD test sets in 13 languages: Amazon product reviews, Tweets, and Restaurant reviews. Results echo the OOD performance decline observed in the monolingual English setting. Further, (i) counterfactuals from the original high-resource language do improve OOD generalization in the low-resource language, and (ii) our newly proposed cost-effective approaches reach similar or up to +3.1% better accuracy than CAD for Amazon and Restaurant reviews.},

  abstract        = {Out-of-scope (OOS) intent classification is an emerging field in conversational AI research. The goal is to detect out-of-scope user intents that do not belong to a predefined intent ontology. However, establishing a reliable OOS detection system is challenging due to limited data availability. This situation necessitates solutions rooted in few-shot learning techniques. For such few-shot text classification tasks, prompt-based learning has been shown more effective than conventionally finetuned large language models with a classification layer on top. Thus, we advocate for exploring prompt-based approaches for OOS intent detection. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation metric, the Area Under the In-scope and Out-of-Scope Characteristic curve (AU-IOC). This metric addresses the shortcomings of current evaluation standards for OOS intent detection. AU-IOC provides a comprehensive assessment of a model’s dual performance capacities: in-scope classification accuracy and OOS recall. Under this new evaluation method, we compare our prompt-based OOS detector against 3 strong baseline models by exploiting the metadata of intent annotations, i.e., intent description. Our study found that our prompt-based model achieved the highest AU-IOC score across different data regimes. Further experiments showed that our detector is insensitive to a variety of intent descriptions. An intriguing finding shows that for extremely low data settings (1- or 5-shot), employing a naturally phrased prompt template boosts the detector’s performance compared to rather artificially structured template patterns.},
